# Climate-AI

Created a fast-running AI model of the Earthâ€™s climate that runs on a laptop or PC using historical climate data and public simulation outputs.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**:

The goal of this project is to develop a fast-running AI model of Earth's climate that can be executed on a standard laptop or PC. This model will utilize historical climate data and public simulation outputs to predict future climate conditions and understand past climate behavior.
